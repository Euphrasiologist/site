# Research

My research is focused on evolutionary biology, ecology, genetics, population genetics, and genomics. I completed my honours degree in Biological Sciences at the University of Edinburgh in 2016. I received my PhD from the University of Edinburgh in 2020, on taxonomic complexity in British Eyebright (*Euphrasia*) species with Alex Twyford. Shortly after, during the pandemic, I began work at the Wellcome Sanger Institute working on the Darwin Tree of Life project as a Senior Bioinformatician with Mark Blaxter. I left in 2022 to go to industry, and have worked at the Bank of England as a Data Scientist for the past year. As of November 2023, I'll working full time as a Lecturer in plant ecology and genetics at Anglia Ruskin University.

## A few themes

Currently my work encompasses:

- Plant mitochondrial genomics
- Host parasite associations in *Euphrasia*
- Plant hybridisation, in particular cross-ploidy hybridisation.
