# Welcome to the blog

These blog posts are written as markdown documents and converted to HTML by the <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark">pulldown-cmark</a> crate in Rust. The Rust code itself is based on a static site generator codebase from <a href="https://github.com/rpruizc/static_site">here (thanks Rodolfo Ruiz!)</a>.

Syntax highlighting of code blocks is generated by <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> with the Nord theme, which is a theme I like in VSCode.

This is a bash block:

```bash
# make a variable
VAR="example string"
# echo it back
echo $VAR
```

And this is a Rust block:

```rust
// convert i32 to a String
// which is silly because it already
// implements Display
pub fn test(t: i32) -> String {
    t.into()
}

// call it and print
println!("{}", test(3));
```

After many iterations of a version of my website, I like this one the best. I am hoping to write more about general software dev stuff, tools I like, and maybe some other stuff tossed in. Some ad-hoc plans for the moment:

- Go through some of the details of some Rust software projects I've been working on
- Maybe some tutorials/walkthroughs
- Development of this website
